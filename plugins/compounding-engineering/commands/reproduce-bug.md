Look at github issue #$ARGUMENTS and read the issue description and comments.

Then, run the following agents in parallel to reproduce the bug:

1. Task bug-reproduction-validator(issue_description)
2. Task log-investigator(issue_description)

Then think about the places it could go wrong looking at the codebase. Look for logging output we can look for.

Then, run the following agents in parallel again to find any logs that could help us reproduce the bug.

1. Task bug-reproduction-validator(issue_description)
2. Task log-investigator(issue_description)

Keep running these agents until you have a good idea of what is going on.
