## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-03

### Changed - BREAKING

This is a **major version change** that replaces Ruby/Rails support with Java/Spring Boot support.

**Migration from Ruby to Java:**
- Replaced `kieran-rails-reviewer` with `java-code-reviewer` - strict Java best practices reviewer
- Replaced `dhh-rails-reviewer` with `spring-boot-reviewer` - Spring Boot conventions reviewer
- Updated `lint` agent to support Java linting tools (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, Spotless)
- Replaced `andrew-kane-gem-writer` skill with `maven-library-writer` - Maven library creation patterns
- Replaced `dhh-ruby-style` skill with `spring-boot-style` - Modern Spring Boot coding patterns
- Removed `dspy-ruby` skill (Ruby-specific DSPy framework)
- Updated plugin keywords from `rails`, `ruby` to `java`, `spring-boot`, `maven`
- Updated all documentation to use Java/Spring Boot examples

**Component counts:**
- Agents: 24 (same count, replaced Ruby agents with Java agents)
- Commands: 19 (unchanged)
- Skills: 10 (reduced from 11 due to removing dspy-ruby)

## [2.8.3] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **`gemini-imagegen` skill** - Added critical documentation about file format handling. Gemini returns JPEG by default, so using `.jpg` extension is required to avoid "Image does not match media type" API errors. Added examples for PNG conversion when needed and format verification.

## [2.8.2] - 2025-11-28

### Changed

- **`gemini-imagegen` skill** - Updated to use only Pro model (`gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`) by default. Removed regular Nano Banana model reference. Added explicit options for aspect ratio (1:1 to 21:9) and resolution (1K default, 2K, 4K). Simplified documentation with clear defaults.

## [2.8.1] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **`/plan` command** - Added "Create Issue" option to post-generation menu. Detects project tracker (GitHub or Linear) from user's CLAUDE.md (`project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear`) and creates issues using `gh issue create` or Linear CLI.

## [2.8.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **`julik-frontend-races-reviewer` agent** - New review agent specializing in JavaScript and Stimulus code race conditions. Reviews frontend code with Julik's eye for timing issues, DOM event handling, promise management, setTimeout/setInterval cleanup, CSS animations, and concurrent operation tracking. Includes patterns for Hotwire/Turbo compatibility and state machine recommendations.

## [2.7.0] - 2025-11-27

### Changed

- **`/codify` → `/compound`** - Renamed the documentation command to better reflect the compounding engineering philosophy. Each documented solution compounds your team's knowledge. The old `/codify` command still works but shows a deprecation notice and calls `/compound`.
- **`codify-docs` → `compound-docs`** - Renamed the skill to match the new command name.

### Updated

- All documentation, philosophy sections, and references updated to use `/compound` and `compound-docs`

## [2.6.2] - 2025-11-27

### Improved

- **`/plan` command** - Added AskUserQuestion tool for post-generation options and year note (2025) for accurate date awareness.
- **Research agents** - Added year note (2025) to all 4 research agents (best-practices-researcher, framework-docs-researcher, git-history-analyzer, repo-research-analyst) for accurate date awareness when searching documentation.

## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-26

### Improved

- **`/plan` command** - Replaced vague "keep asking questions" ending with clear post-generation options menu. Users now see 4 explicit choices via AskUserQuestion: Start `/work`, Run `/plan_review`, Simplify, or Rework.

## [2.6.0] - 2024-11-26

### Removed

- **`feedback-codifier` agent** - Removed from workflow agents. Agent count reduced from 24 to 23.

## [2.5.0] - 2024-11-25

### Added

- **`/report-bug` command** - New slash command for reporting bugs in the compounding-engineering plugin. Provides a structured workflow that gathers bug information through guided questions, collects environment details automatically, and creates a GitHub issue in the EveryInc/every-marketplace repository. Designed to be user-friendly for anyone using the plugin.

## [2.4.1] - 2024-11-24

### Improved

- **design-iterator agent** - Added focused screenshot guidance: always capture only the target element/area instead of full page screenshots. Includes browser_resize recommendations, element-targeted screenshot workflow using browser_snapshot refs, and explicit instruction to never use fullPage mode. Also added step to load relevant design skills (e.g., Swiss design) before starting iterations.

## [2.4.0] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed

- **MCP Configuration** - Moved MCP servers back to `plugin.json` following working examples from anthropics/life-sciences plugins. Removed `.mcp.json` file as it's not the correct approach.
- **Context7 URL** - Updated to use HTTP type with correct endpoint URL.

## [2.3.0] - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- **MCP Configuration** - Moved MCP servers from inline `plugin.json` to separate `.mcp.json` file per Claude Code best practices for plugin MCP integration.

## [2.2.1] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed

- **Playwright MCP Server** - Added missing `"type": "stdio"` field required for MCP server configuration to load properly.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- **Context7 MCP Server** - Bundled Context7 for instant framework documentation lookup. Provides up-to-date docs for Rails, React, Next.js, and 100+ other frameworks.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- **Playwright MCP Server** - Bundled `@playwright/mcp` for browser automation across all projects using this plugin. Provides screenshot, navigation, click, fill, and evaluate tools.

### Changed

- Replaced all Puppeteer references with Playwright across agents and commands:
  - `bug-reproduction-validator` agent
  - `design-iterator` agent
  - `design-implementation-reviewer` agent
  - `figma-design-sync` agent
  - `generate_command` command

## [2.0.2] - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- `design-iterator` agent - Updated description to emphasize proactive usage when design work isn't coming together on first attempt. Added examples showing how to suggest 5x or 10x iterations when initial changes don't fully resolve design issues.

## [2.0.1] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions with versioning requirements and pre-commit checklist
- `docs/solutions/plugin-versioning-requirements.md` - Detailed workflow documentation for maintaining version, CHANGELOG, and README in sync
